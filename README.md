# MIPS_SCDP
Follow the steps to run the project: (1) Setup the "LOGISIM" software. (2) Download the complete project. (3) The "main.circ" is the original scdp circuit file & the "modifified.circ" is the scdp with "jr" instruction extension. (4) Open the main.circ file and load the "inst mem main" file in the instruction memory & the "data mem main (if part)/data mem main (else part)" in the data memory (in the if part the code will jump to if caluse and ends, similarly in the else part the code will only work on the else clause and ends) (5) Similarly, for the modified circuit, open the modified.circ file and load the instruction memory and data memory. (6) Press the clock of the instruction memroy to run the programs instruction by instruction.
